title: "Integration of latest REST/JSON API features into Unity Frontend"
---

As a continued result of our [previous standardization and implementation][api-news-post] of our [REST/JSON API of the UFrameIT server][api-spec],
we are now able to expose all new features in our [Unity plugin][unity-plugin].
These features include:

- string interpolation (todo: simplify)
- view completion (todo: simplify)
- hints (todo: simplify)

todo: maybe add screenshots?
