## Technical directions on adding a blog post

To add a new blog/news/activity post, create a file in this directory, taking
the existing files as examples.

Each post needs some specific parameters:

 * **layout** use *post* for a classical post look, or *slides* for md slides 
 * **title** the title of your post
 * **subtitle** (optionnal) a subtitle. It will be adjuncted to your title in the post link and just under the title in the post page
 * **location** (optional) a location (especially for workshops, conferences, job openings, etc)
 * **author** the author of the post (you don't want to push yourself forward? Just write *the KWARC team* or whatever you like)
 * **date** the date *YYYY/MM/DD*
 * **redirect_from** not needed for new posts, this is just the redirect link from old activities pages on the former site
 * **tags** a list of tag. The first tag is the *type* of activity (talk, blogpost, workshop, etc). The available tags are in the folder */_tagpages/* you can create news tags by adding a page there and then adding the tag to your post.
