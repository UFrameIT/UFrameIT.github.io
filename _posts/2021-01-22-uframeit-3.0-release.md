title: "Release of UFrameIT 3.0"
---

We have released **UFrameIT 3.0** ([binaries for Windows/Linux/macOS](https://github.com/UFrameIT/UFrameIT/releases/tag/3.0), [source](https://github.com/UFrameIT/UFrameIT/tree/3.0)):
the third version of our game prototyping the [*FrameIT approach*](https://uframeit.org/#the-uframeit-framework-and-serious-games).
The release aggregates new features, UI improvements, and many bug fixes &mdash; something we have been working on for in the last months.

A [complete changelog is available](https://github.com/UFrameIT/UFrameIT/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). The major points are:

**Added:**

- Dynamic labels for fact slots of a scroll: the variable names in the UI now adapt according to the assigned facts.
- Hint feature: having assigned some (but not all) slots of a scroll, you can request hints for how you might want to fill the remaining slots

Both added features have been implemented generically in the MMT system and can be used for all future games without additional effort!

**Changed:**

- Performance increases on the MMT server side; entailing that the Unity UI is more reactive.
- Made UI much slicker

We plan to release an in-depth post about the new features in the future, so stay tuned!
