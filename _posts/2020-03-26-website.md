title: "UFrameIT has a Website"

We made a simple [website](https://uframeit.github.io/) for the
[UFrameIT](https://kwarc.info/systems/frameit/) project. This will be the main showcase of
all developments.

The FrameIT project builds a Framework for Serious Games by combining Virtual Worlds with Mathematical Knowledge Management.
